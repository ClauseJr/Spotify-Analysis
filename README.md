## Executive Summary

### Overview Findings

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Spotify Musical Analysis of different Artists.
The goal was to identify the key drivers of turnover and create a dashboard that HR leaders can use to monitor, predict, and reduce attrition.

The interactive Power BI dashboard enables HR to:
  -  Monitor KPIs like attrition rate, employee count, average tenure, and average salary.
  -  Drill down by demographics, job role, and department.
  -  Identify high-risk groups to design targeted retention strategies.
